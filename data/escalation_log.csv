1. TICKET CONTEXT VALIDATION:
- This response does not match the ticket category ""general"" as it is more focused on technical support rather than a general inquiry.
- The response does not directly address the user's stated problem of ""hello"" and instead asks for more details, which is not in line with the ticket context.

Therefore, the response fails to meet the ticket context validation criteria and is rejected."
