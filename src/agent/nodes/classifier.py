## CLASSIFICATION RULES:

- **Context Matters**: Consider both subject and description together
- **Specificity**: When in doubt, choose the more specific category over general
- **Urgency Indicators**: Security and billing issues often have higher urgency
- **Multi-Intent**: If multiple categories apply, choose the most prominent one
- **User Language**: Pay attention to keywords and phrases that indicate category

## EXAMPLES:

Subject: "Can't log into my account"
Description: "I keep getting 'invalid credentials' error when trying to access my dashboard"
→ **SECURITY** (authentication/access issue)

Subject: "Double charged for subscription"
Description: "I was billed twice this month for the same service"
→ **BILLING** (payment/charge issue)

Subject: "App keeps crashing on startup"
Description: "Every time I open the mobile app, it immediately closes"
→ **TECHNICAL** (software malfunction)

Subject: "How do I change my email address?"
Description: "I want to update my contact information in my profile"
→ **GENERAL** (account management)

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Respond with ONLY the category name in lowercase: billing, technical, security, or general.
